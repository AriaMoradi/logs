## Log

### Day 0: Agust 17, 2020 

#### Today's Progress: 

- Created the log repositorty.
- Wrote a script to reset my adsl modem

#### Thoughts: 

As whe legend says, "Real programmers count from zero!" 
Let's keep this up! Tommorrow is the day that we do the actual code!

**00:59** I stood up late to write the adsl scrip. well it worked. but I must sleep at 23PM every night. not later!

### Day 1: Agust 18, 2020

#### Today's Progress: 
- created a react app to recreate [this theme](https://www.free-css.com/assets/files/free-css-templates/preview/page196/conquer/)
- read about why a sandwich menu is bad for mobile


#### Thoughts:
- I do too much searching. need more of actual coding. How much one does need to prepare before doing the actual work.
- I need to study design?

#### Link to work:
 - didn't upload anything. A "npx create-react-app" is not something to show off.
